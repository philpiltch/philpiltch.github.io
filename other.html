<p style="font-size: 20pt">Can-Bike Instructor </p>

<p style="font-size: 12pt">Can-Bike is a bicycle safety course, akin to Young Drivers, to teach bike and road handling skills. 
    Courses are run by local groups with instructors certified through Cycle Canada's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferral" href="http://canbikecanada.ca/#">Can-Bike</a> program.
    <br>I taught Can-Bike through the City of Toronto from 1991 to 2001.

<p style="font-size: 20pt">Long-distance Cycling </p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt" >I became interested in long-distance cycling in the early 1990s starting with completing 160 km (Imperial Century) rides.
I soon joined a Randonneuring club, which organized rides of even longer distances. These are noncompetetive rides where one had a fixed time limit 
to complete a ride with checkpoints along the route. Much of the challenge is mental and good time management is key to succesfully completing a ride.
The club is affiliated with a central club in France that holds a 1200 Km ride, Paris-Brest-Paris (PBP) every 4 years. One has to complete a set qualifying
rides with your local club in order to participate in PBP. In 1999 I completed PBP. You can read about my experiences <a href="pbp.html">here</a>.
