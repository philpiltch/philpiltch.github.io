    I am a life long learner, with many interests. I am an IT Profesional with over 15 years experience supporting 
    application systems for retail businesses. I have a Bachelors of Art in Mathematics and Fine Arts from Sonoma State, California
    and a Masters in Mathematics from York U, Toronto. I recently completed a data science diploma at BrainStation, Toronto. 
    My journey has just begun with Data Analyis, Machine Learning and more. <br><br>
    I also love being outdoors, cycling the backroads, hiking scenic trails and in winter, skiing and skating. Much of my character
    in my professional life is reflected in participation in long-distance cycling, where I have achieved success through persistence 
    and pushing through setbacks, with an attitude that quiting is not an option.
